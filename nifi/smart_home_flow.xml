This is a placeholder for your NiFi flow. 
You should use the NiFi UI (http://localhost:8080/nifi) to visually create the flow as described in the README, then export it and replace this file.

Flow outline:
- ConsumeKafka (topic: smart-home-sensors)
- EvaluateJsonPath (extract fields)
- RouteOnAttribute (route based on alert conditions: temp > 28, motion+armed, door+night)
- PutKafka (topic: smart-home-events for alerts, smart-home-history for all)
